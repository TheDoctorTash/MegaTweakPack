[Disk Cleanup]
Windows Update Cleanup=This will clean-up files and folders left by Windows Updates. This Task will temporarily restart the Windows Update service (wuauserv). Recommendation: Cleanup

Windows Component Store=The component store (WinSxS folder) contains all the components that make-up Windows to allow you operate your system. Windows uses this folder to store files that are needed for your Windows installation, as well as backups or updates to those files. This will clean-up Component Store (WinSxS folder) using /StartComponentCleanup with Dism Command. Recommendation: This switch leaves an option to uninstall the latest updates and roll back to older versions. You can reduce size with this option.

Downloaded Program Files=This will clean-up ActiveX controls and Java applets used by Internet Explorer. They are temporarily stored on your hard disk. This folder is essentially useless — ActiveX is an extremely dated technology that’s full of security holes, and Java applets are rare. Recommendation: Cleanup 

Temporary Internet Files=This will clean-up webpages stored on your hard disk for quick viewing (cache). Your personalized settings for webpages will be left intact. Recommendation: Cleanup

DirectX Shader Cache=This will clean-up files created by the graphics system which can speed up application load time and improve responsiveness. They will be re-generated as needed. Recommendation: Cleanup

Delivery Optimization Files=This Service is a part of Windows 10 that uses your computer's bandwidth to upload app and Windows updates to other computers. This will clean-up data that's no longer needed, except for uploading to other PCs. This Task will temporarily restart the Delivery Optimization (dosvc) and Background Intelligent Transfer Service (bits). Recommendation: If the feature is disabled, you can safely cleanup these files, otherwise Cleanmgr+ will stop the service for the cleanup.

Recycle Bin=This will clean-up files you have deleted from your computer. These files are not permanently removed until you empty the Recycle Bin. Recommendation: Check before cleanup

Temporary Files=Programs frequently store data in a temporary folder. This will clean-up all temporary files. Do not delete these files after installing updates or new programs that require a reboot. Sometimes these processes use temp files to finish installation. Recommendation: Check before cleanup

Thumbnails=Windows keeps a copy of all your picture, video and document thumbnails so they can be display quickly when you open a folder. If you clean-up these thumbnails, they will be automatically recreated as needed. Recommendation: Cleanup, as they are always recreated.

Internet History= Every time you go online from your computer, your browser — whether you use Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox or something else — saves a copy of every page that you visit. Through tabulating URLs, Internet history facilitates a quick reference or lookup of previously visited pages. Recommendation: Cleanup

Offline Web Pages=You can save web pages for “offline” browsing in Internet Explorer. Your “Offline Webpages” are web pages that have specifically been saved for offline use, and checking this will clean-up them. Recommendation: Cleanup

Game Statistic Files=This will clean-up random statistics accumulated by Windows Games when you play them and stored in files. Recommendation: Cleanup

Clipboard=The clipboard stores all kinds of information (text, images, videos, files including shortcuts or folders) that you have copied from one place, and you plan to use in another place. Recommendation: Cleanup

Prefetch Data=Prefetch is a feature that stores specific data about the application you run in order to help them start faster. The Prefetch folder is self cleaning at 128 entries by Windows. Recommendation: Cleanup the prefetch files during periodic maintenance.

Recent Documents=All over Windows, you'll see menus with the most recently used items for a given application. Maybe it's a document you recently opened, or some videos you recently watched. This will clean-up recent items and frequent places. Recommendation: Cleanup

Run (in Start Menu)=When you open the Run Window (Win+R), you can tap on the arrow to open a drop down list. This list contains all the command that you have entered previously. This is called the Run history. Recommendation: Cleanup

User File History=File History was first introduced in Windows 8, and has been improved in Windows 10. Windows stores file versions temporarily on this disk before copying them to the designated File History disk. Over time, you'll have a complete history of your files. If the originals are lost, damaged, or deleted, you can restore them. You can also browse and restore different versions of your files. Recommendation: Check before cleanup. If you delete these files, you will lose some file history.

DNS Cache=When you access a website, your computer is essentially requesting web data from another computer on the Internet. It uses the Domain Name System (DNS). Whenever Windows learns of a certain route — e.g. from your computer to Mirinsoft servers — it temporarily remembers that route in its DNS cache. However, when the DNS route changes, your cached copy of the route becomes outdated, and this can cause problems (like not being able to load a website. Clearing the DNS cache is absolutely harmless. Recommendation: Cleanup

BranchCache=BranchCache allows computers at a local branch office to cache data from a file or web server on a WAN (wide area network). The data can be cached either on the client computers, in distributed cache mode, or on a local server, in hosted cache mode. By caching data locally, there is a reduction in WAN traffic and applications often respond faster due to using local files instead of retrieving them over the WAN.

Print Queue=This will clean-up all print queues. If you’re doing this on a server, it’s a good idea to first make sure there are no other print jobs being processed for any of the other printers on the server because doing this step will delete those jobs also. Recommendation: Check before cleanup

Active Setup Temp Folders=These files should no longer be needed. They were originally created by a setup program that is no longer running. Recommendation: Cleanup

Windows Upgrade Log Files=When you upgrade Windows, the System creates log files. These log files can Help identify and troubleshot problems that occur. If you don't have any upgrade-related problems, feel free to clean-up these. Recommendation: Cleanup

System Error Memory Dump Files=When Windows crashes, known as a - blue screen of death - the system creates a memory dump file. This can help identify exactly what went wrong. However, these files can use a large amount of space. If you don't plan on trying to troubleshoot any blue screens of death you can clean-up these files. Recommendation: Cleanup, very large

System Archived Windows Error ...=When a program crashes, Windows creates an error report and sends it to Microsoft. These error reports can help you identify and fix problems. Archived error reports have been sent to Microsoft. This will clean-up these, but you won’t be able to view reports about program crashes. Recommendation: Cleanup

System Queued Windows Error ...=This will clean-up queued error reports that have not yet been sent to Microsoft. Recommendation: Cleanup

System Hibernation File=Hiberfil.sys is a file the system creates for the computer to enter hibernation mode. Hibernation copies everything stored in the computer’s memory and writes it to your hard drive in the form of the hiberfil.sys file. Recommendation: If you often put your system in Hibernation mode, you should not delete this file. You need it to resume your system. If you do not use Hibernation mode, and instead prefer to shut down your system at the end of the day, you can clean-up this file.

Compress System Installation=This will compress your Windows 10 installation and apps files to reduce the overall footprint of Windows 10 making room to store more valuable files. NTFS compression works similarly to other types of compression, like zipping a file. Recommendation: If you are really stuck with tight storage space, you can run the NTFS drive compression. On a normal PC with a decent storage, this will slow down the system and affect the user experience. The Compression can be reverted using the Undo function below.
